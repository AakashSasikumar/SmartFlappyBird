**This project is still a work in progress**

- I tried using OpenAI gym's flappy bird, but I couldn't get it to work on Windows, so PLE was the best alternative (works on all major OSs).
- PLE proved to be a huge problem to multi-thread so I forked [sourabhv's version of flappy bird](https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird/) and I've been trying to modify that to suit my needs.
